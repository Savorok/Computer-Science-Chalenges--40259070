                        Today I started writing notes on NNs. Took notes on the makeup of a neural net and learned how to understand NN diagrams. Also took notes on how calculations occur in a NN and derived the formula of a neuron calculation. I referenced it against the actual equation from the literature and had derived it correctly. Looked into a few different activation functions and took notes.

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Today I took notes on how NNs learn and looked into the very basics of backpropagation, as I might need to use it at some point so understanding the basics will benefit me when and if I start to research it properly.
<br>I finished programming my first Neural net in python. It is a perception matrix that is able to classify for the OR problem<br><br>I followed the article from towardsdatascience.com to make the NN.
<br>As I made it in python, I had to set up python on my computer. I downloaded python 3.8 and used notepad++ to write code in as I didn’t like using IDLE which was provided with python. I don’t like using notepad++ either so I will need to find a better text editor for writing in python.
<br>This was my first-time using python so I’m still getting used to the syntax and am going to have to take notes on the basics and theory.
<br>Due to this inexperience in phyton syntax there where a few errors in my code that where due to syntax errors that took a while to figure out and fix but the NN does now work. <br></p>

                            This week I was able to finish everything on my to-do list. This could be an indication that I’m focusing on things that are too easy or too familiar. This week I plan to essentially throw myself into the deep end and go straight into the coded examples of poetry generation from gwern. Ill either be able to understand it or ill gather information on what I need to know. Ill think about what ill put in the to-do list over the next day and then write it up on Monday morning.

                            Today I was only able to get a little bit of work done in the morning, so I used this time to create a virtual environment in python. I did this as when I was reading through some code on gwern it said about setting up a tensorflow virtual environment so after googling it, it recommended using a Venv. I created the Venv and assume that I will need to load tensorflow in as a module so I will do that tomorrow. I currently don’t really know what way I’m supposed to emulate the results from gwern at the minute I think it is basically just importing packages and running them, but I don’t really know so I’m going to need to look into it more.

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">As I created a venv yesterday, today I was going to install the tensorflow module into it. I kept getting errors about no version and after digging around on stack overflow I discovered there’s no version of tensor flow for python 3.8 so I will have to use python 3.7. I couldn’t find a way to downgrade pyhton in the venv I made and also found out the method of creating venvs I used is exclusive to python 3.8. after looking around on YouTube for tutorials on making 3.7 environments I saw a tool called anaconda being used so I downloaded it with the hopes it would help me make the environment. Thankfully it did and it was an easy process with a gui wizard. The 3.7 environment was easily setup and I installed the TensorFlow module into it. 
<br>I don’t really know where to go from here but I did see this on the Gwern site: “I assume you have a fully-working Nvidia CUDA &amp; GPU-enabled Tensorflow installation, and have either run other DL code successfully or run the TF installation checklist’s MNIST toy example to verify that you have working GPU training.” So I’m going to look into these 2 things to make sure I have tensor flow working. &nbsp;<br></p>

The first thing it says to do is get a git clone of the pretrained model and project. I had never used Git hub to clone a project before just to download already compiled programmes. I googled how to get a clone and found I could get it through visual studio code. For some reason every time I tried to use the Git clone command in vis studio it would say command not found so I need to figure out how to fix this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

                            I figured out the github problem, I found out that you must have the github framework installed. Once I had this installed the git clone worked fine and I got a clone of the project. The next thing I had to do was setup the venv for this clone I set it up in anaconda with python 3.7. after making the venv I ran the python --version command but kept getting “Pyhton not recognised as a command”. After a quick bit of googling I found a YouTube tutorial on how to fix it. I had to create a system global variable with a path to the python install folder. This fixed the python problem. Next I installed the 4 modules that the tutorial said I needed this was fine as I had done this before, so I knew how to do this. Next I downloaded the model. The dataset was the next thing I needed to make. This was just a plain text notepad doc with a specific separator between blocks of text. I grabbed a few poems from Gutenberg poetry. Not enough for a good dataset but should be fine for just learning how to set it up to train on this data.

                            This week I couldn’t get the GPT-2 model trained and making samples due to the confusion at the start of the week. Currently I am working right on the edge of my understanding so each step of the tutorial I am following requires quite a bit of googling around it to get things to work. Hopefully next week I will be able to get the model working. I had a little look at the webpage and a bit of the HTML. Ill need to finish this next week. I plan to do the tutorial on setting up the GPT-2 model.

                        Now I have to encode my dataset for training. This is where most of the big problems occurred. First, I found out through error messages that I was missing a few python modules, numpy and toposort. So I installed these. The next problem was with the version of tensorflow I was using. The version I had installed was the latest stable build, but it turns out functionality that was in an older version of TF but not in this one was needed. So, I uninstalled the current version of TF and installed TF v1.14. The next problem was with directory locations I spent a good part of the morning going through stack overflow and other forums to find a fix for this error. Instead of going through the source code to fix it myself I emailed my supervisor for help. He suggested going through the source code, so I did and the problem was a lot easier to fix than I thought it was going to be. So in hindsight I should have just gone through the code before I emailed him even though I was overwhelmed by it as I would have very quickly noticed that I was a rather easy fix. The problem was that the code was trying to find a directory it didn’t have access to so all I had to do was paste in the file path and then the encoding worked fine. The next step was training. Before this worked, I spent a few hours debugging error messages most of which ended up being easy directory fixes. Once these where fixed I started training and it was producing samples. So, I successfully set up the GPT-2 model.

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Today I wanted to analyse the output I was getting from my model. In last weeks meting John said something towards the end of the meeting about how GPT-2 has some inherent problems so I wanted to see if I could notice some major flaws in the samples it created. I had quite a large number of samples from my poetry model as I had left it training when I want to class. So I started to go through them and noticed they where all a bit weird. I noticed it would find a phrase or word it knew and would repeat it over and over in the same sample or in some cases it would even just generate a poem I have as an input word for word. I thought this could be due to the fact I used a rather small data set with only 3 or 4 poems, as my main focus was to get it working first. I decided the best way to analyse the output would be to setup a new model and train it on a dataset that I would know all the contents off so I could easily pick up things like duplication and replication. For my new dataset I used all the lyrics from the beetle’s album Sgt pepper’s lonely hearts club band. 
<br>I Picked this album specifically as it had a good few songs in it that don’t entirely follow a generic song in how its written. I believed the absurdity in the lyrics would give the model a bit of leeway in creating new songs so that if it didn’t make a sample that really made sense you could still kind of see its similarities from songs in the albums.
<br>This essentially turned out to be a complete failure in the hope I had in GPT-2 making something of value. The samples actually managed to get worse as generations went on. It managed to write an entire song that was over 100 lines long where every line started with eh word “Where”, and this was an example where it at least produced something that resembled a song. 
<br>This experiment really changed my outlook on this project. Originally, I assumed I would be able to do this with GPT-2 with just tweaking of the model and a specific type of training. Now I know I will need to find at least some other method to help if not take the place of GPT-2 in this project. &nbsp;<br></p>

                            Today I just tidied up the website a bit and thought about the future of this project due to my concerns with GPT-2. I didn’t speak much about how I made the website earlier so ill cover it here. To make my website I used visual studio code I learned the basics from w3Schools.com. I didn’t use many fancy implementations on the website except a small accordion that required a little bit of java script. I am happy enough to work with html and found it easy to pick up.

                            This week I got the model up and working and was nothing less than disappointed with the results. The main thing I noticed is that I will need to apply some other sort of method to GPT-2. I’m going to start looking into NLP processes and some research papers of GPT-2 NLP combinations like john suggested. I think I’m going to need to apply some sort of structure with NLP to a GPT-2 generation like process. And I think ill need some sort of after pass to go over the result as I think structuring GPT-2 will just result in structured nonsense. So some sort of cleaning up will need to occur to make the end result make any sense. The though of starting from scratch to now learn a new method is very daunting but seeing as I was able to do it for GPT-2 I don’t see why I shouldn’t be able to do it for NLP.

                        I only got around to starting work today as ive been trying to get coursework up to date for csc 1031 as ive had a bug in the code that ive been working on so this has been on the back of my mind. Today I read a few articles on nlp and am looking for research papers on nlp and gpt-2 as john suggested.

                            This week I didn’t really get much done. I tried to find some papers on language processing but didnt get to far. I tried using the top 100 journal rankings like john said but got frustrated when I couldn’t figure it out so just left it. Coursework for csc 1031 is still priority at the minute and looks like it will be until after next week so im going to try and chip away at finding research papers next week but I don’t think ill make any significant progress.

                        Getting this coursework done for csc 1031 is still main priority but I felt that I needed to at least say something in the diary so that I wouldn’t have just a big gap of nothing done. I haven’t been extensively researching into the topic but have watched a few videos on YouTube here and there related to neural networks and text generation with the hope that even if I cant sit and devote time to learning something new I can at least stay familiar with the material.

                            FINALLY!! I have a bit of breathing room now so got time to start properly searching for these research papers. I figured out how to use google scholar and am going through the Engineering and computer science topic as well as the artificial intelligence topic and gathering all the papers that have anything to do with text generation and then to an extent things that have keywords that I extracted about the topic at the start such as GAN’s.

                            I plan to spend this morning just gathering papers. I got the github repo setup and downloaded the desktop gui as john suggested. Today in our meeting we talked about other ways of thinking to solve the problem. This included trying to convince people who are higher in the field to help or guide us. I will be visiting Cambridge in a few weeks to visit a friend so taking this thinking into account I am going to try and see if I am able to talk to any of the researchers about my project and see if they could point me in the right direction or give me any help. I also talked to john about the future of my project as currently my project is more researched based than practical. It is more likely I will not create any end product of use and more likely I will produce small amounts of work that could help people who would be able to make more significant results. For me this is a little disappointing as the main drive and joy that I get for projects is mainly based on the end product that I can see myself making, But I also see the value in this as it is a more realistic outcome if I where to take on a researcher role in the future.

                        My coursework for csc 1031 has finally been submitted and I have finished my exam for my databases module so I can Finlay put a lot more of my time into this module. Like john mentioned last Thursday as the subject is rather new there is most likely not a survey paper or a goto place to find the most relevant and best papers. So I am going to work on creating a physical map to show where I got papers from and this should visualize the paths to follow to find papers on the subject.

I had to email someone to request one as it was behind a paywall so hopefully, they can get back to me otherwise I will use the university’s library o try and request it. I also started looking at the authors of the most relevant papers the first paper being : towards controlled generation of text. One of the authors is the PhD student Zhiting Hu. I found his website and he has worked on a number of related appears and even produced software for controlled text generation. I am now going to look into his colleuges and see if they have research in the area and I might email him to see if he can point me in any good directions.

                            Today I woke up to an email back from Zhiting Hu. He recommended trying out the following library’s for implementation: Huggingface transformers, Texar or fairseq. I’ve heard of the first two, one from john and one which was made by Zhiting Hu. The last one I will need to research. Got an email from john today linking to a reddit post, ill need to check that out. Just uploaded all my research papers and my first neural network to my github and invited john as a collaborator. Started using a tool called Mobirise4 to make the blog today.

                        Today I have just been working on getting this blog up to date with my current research. The tool I am using morbirise4 is very handy and I have found the best way to use it is to make all of the website functionality and basics in the program and add the rest of the content I need to manually as HTML. The only problem is that if you add something with HTML and then keep working on the application it wipes all the HTML: you did so unfortunately I need to add back all the code in formatted boxes that I have been working on for the past half hour but at least I know now before I did more HTML

                        Today I found a video series on NLP on YouTube, I sent the link to Ronan as well as I thought it might also be useful to him. From now until the end of my project I just need to refine what I have found and created to the best of my ability. I plan to work a lot more on code now as apart from the code in the first 4 weeks I have only done a small amount of code. I would like to be able to get some other text generation methds working like setting up texar, have a proper dive into huggingfaces librarys.

                            Today I started messing about with texar I got a venv set up for running it in. getting it loaded in and ready was easy enough as I understand the basics of seeting up things like that in a venv now. I was looking at the models they have on it and one of them is the same gpt-2 model that I used for making poetry. Maybe a possible approach to furthering my project could be to do a comparison of all the models for text generation there are and see what works in each or what isnt as good etc and propose or even try and implement a combination of the models. Currently I think maybe possibly passing the output samples into another model for training data. This is only a wild guess but in theory if the model works as it should this could be possible however it is more likely this went be able to happen due to the uncertainty of text generation I have experienced this far.

                            Today I have been working on texar, I was looking at the list of models available and saw there is a dialogue model. I tried to set this up mainly because it interests me but it is still relevant to the movie script generation as it could be used for dialogue in the scripts. However there is a lot of errors with compatibility, going through the README and following it I cant seem to get past the first command which is downloading the data set, This is really annoying me because I know it’s a problem that I know how to solve and have solved before but I just cant seem to figure it out. Im stuck in an infinite loop of getting different version of modules. The error messages I am getting are saying im missing modules so I download the missing modules then run the command again to be told the version are incompatible so I change the version to match what it tells me to and then if I run it again it says that the new version I just installed isnt compatible with certain commands so when I get another version the same happens again. I have been trawling through stack overflow for solutions and im finding people with the exact same errors and when I follow the fixes people have proposed it fixes the problem for the people on stack overflow but just puts me into a deeper rabbit.&nbsp;hole of broken and incompatible versions. I have decided to save my sanity I will take a break now and try again tomorrow.</p>

                            I started from fresh today to see if that would magically help me. It didn’t. I keep ending up in the same loop of errors, so I decided to just leave the dialogue model and try another one. This didn’t help as I ended up in the same spiral or errors. The only glimmer of hope I have gotten out of trying to fix these errors is that some people on stack overflow have said that the fixes don’t work and that it is due to the anaconda venv tool which I am using. This is both a bleasing and a curse as the problems could be solved by just setting up an independent venv and running it in that independent of anaconda but it also means I know need to learn how to make Venvs in python 3.7 without anaconda. This annoys me as I know python 3.8 or later has inbuild functions for creating venvs easily and I have experience making them in 3.8, but I don’t know how to set up a venv for 3.7 and the fact that there is a standalone program for making venvs in 3.7 leads me to believe that it could be harder to do thus requiring a standalone program. This could be untrue but it has created a mental block for me whether or not I am blowing it out of proportion or am not. We also got word today that our meetings for this module will now take place over discord due to the rising problem with coronavirus I can foresee the whole university closing soon due to this. Unlike my other modules this module shouldn’t be affected at all by this happening due to the independent nature of it anyway.

I still have the option of looking into fairseq and huggingfaces transformers so I will see if I am able to get anything running from them and try and apply it to my idea of comparing the types of models.

                            We got official notice today that queens will be closed for further notice due to the coronavirus. I kind of knew this was coming but am not worried about the outcome this has on this module as this module is mainly independent anyway, I do however think this will affect my other modules and could make end of year examinations a bit harder or cause confusion heading up to them.

                            Due to queens closing until further notice I have moved out of my flat in Belfast back down to live with my dad. This would be irrelevant information except for the fact that the internet at my dad’s house is very sketchy. Compared to what I had in Belfast the internet is a lot slower and has a tendency to crash sometimes, hopefully it wont affect my ability to work on my modules. I have also been talking to my uncle who is currently working on research programme with Durham university for primary school children that is meant to help teach them 5 fundamental technology’s and advancements that will affect their lives in the future, he recommended me to one of the project heads to work on AI as one of the 5 technology’s as he heard I was doing AI with this module. I got confirmation today that I have been written into the project and have a current offer or £300 a day for work. This will include making a simple neural network and explaining it at a primary level. Thankfully due to this module I have a good understanding of the basics of NN’s and I have no reason to believe that this other research project is doable for me, work is expected to start some time over the summer and I have no specified time slot just end dates to complete the work by. If successful this will get me on the radar of academics in the field and get my name on a university research paper.

There where no problems for me however Ronan’s audio was a bit broken for a while but we got it fixed 15mins into the meeting. Me and john talked about how to finish of the project and I have to keep in mind who I am making this for and where I can post it (reddit, forums, etc…) so other people can find it and continue work on it. John had mentioned a subreddit called r/mediasynthesis that could be helpful to my challenge.

                            Today I gave texar one more try. I thought maybe if I could get the exact versions that are mentioned in the documentation that I could get something to work. for me to get the exact version of TF mentioned I would have to build it from source. I followed a YouTube tutorial on building TF from a github source but I ended up with lots of dependency errors when I had it on the Venv, starting next week im going to turn my attention away from texar and try and work on something else as I’m getting nowhere with this.

                        Today I moved my attention from using texar to setup the models to try and set them up myself. I started with BERT which is googles text generation model. As I am used to by now, I was met with mostly version errors from my attempt to get it running. this time the error I was getting was about torch. I tried to manual install, but it kept saying the version doesn’t exist. Im starting to doubt that the problems that I am having are with the actual git repos install instructions. I reckon I might not have dependency’s set up properly or possibly these models are set up for GPU use and I haven’t got any of the drivers or required setup for GPU training. Im going to try and set up a few more models independently of texar and if I keep getting the same or similar errors from my attempts, I will look into GPU training.

                            In our meeting today john emphasised making sure that that planning section is as the template shows it needs to show the specific target audience and how it will help them. Talk about future possible developments. I am mainly trying to produce my research for researches or people who want to work in NLP. It should be able to help people understand the basics easily so they can spend time working on the harder things. Make sure the blog post is a description of what you have done so people could easily pick up what you have been doing. John recommended prioritising the write up over the technical work.

                        Today I worked mainly on updating and improving my planning and learning diary’s as I need to make sure they are formatted like the examples we are given to receive good marks from them. This annoys me a bit as it seems like just checking boxes and requires a lot of stating the obvious and repeating points but I understand that it is required for the project to be marked fairly. I also injured my hand today while working on a personal project outside. I accidently got it caught by a belt sander thankfully it wasn’t that bad but will defiantly take a month or two to heal. It was my right hand so I can still type proficiently so it shouldn’t really hinder my work .

                            Today i found a new model on github called textgenrnn which is shown as an easy way top generate text and to create models. I had to make an interface to work with the model so I made it in python its juts a basic select enter type interface to help set up models. From what ive seen so far this model is a lot less coherent then gpt-2 but is the only other model apart from gpt-2 ive been able to get running, once I finish the interface for this model I will look around for more models for the final comparison. In my interface today I was able to have it so people can generate random samples or can generate prefixed samples (a sample that starts with a specific word)

                            Today I continued to work on my interface for this model. I worked on adding the ability to train the model yourself by giving it a text file. I came across a few problems with this. The main being my inexperience in python. I was writing a lot of my code as I would write it in java or c# so had to go back and adjust it so it works in the python syntax. I got the main functionality working however during testing for some reason a library that I was using just stopped working. I am using a library called Tkinter to open a file dialogue box so you can select your training data and for some reason it refuses to open the dialog box anymore after no code changes or changes in general. This makes no sense to me as I don’t even have an error message to work with. I also had a problem with an unknown character in the dataset. I am testing the model on the datasets provided with the model but they seem to have speech marks like this: (“ ”) which bricks the program as it doesn’t recognise them, this is weird as when I paste them between documents they look the same as normal speech marks but in notepad ++ they are clearly different. I fixed this by doing a find-replace to make then normal speech marks. while writing this my whole computer started freezing up and task manager won’t respond, although all of the venvs and code is currently closed I wonder if the computer is stuck on some code somewhere I will restart my computer to see if that fixes it)

                            Today I finished the interface with textgenrnn and wrote a setup guide into my research document. The interface could be taken further allowing for creating of models with specific parameters but for my purposes of getting as many models running as I can to see the benefits of each the interface is fine as is for me. Next week I plan to see if I can work on another model.

                            Official end of project</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Today marks the end of the official 12 weeks we had for the course. However, john said we are more than welcome to continue our research and I plan to do so. As this is the official end of the project, I want to talk about my thoughts on the past 12 weeks and then also what I plan for the future of this project. When I started this project, I knew nothing about artificial intelligence or neural networks, but had a lot of interest in them. That was the key factor in picking the topic that I chose, and I am really happy that I did choose this one. Out of the 6 modules I undertook in my first year of uni I can say without a doubt that this is the one where I learned the most amount of new information and gained the most amount of technical skill. Which I see as very impressive as the point of the module is to be self-taught. We always had john as mentor in this project and although at the start of the project I felt a bit overwhelmed as to what to do john was able to point me In the direction of things that could be useful. This did result in a few things that I self-taught that ended up being useless to the project as a whole but I know have a much wider and varied set of skills to bring forward with me through the rest of my education and career.  One of the main things this course taught me is that there really isnt an reason that I can’t do whatever I really put my mind to. Before starting this project I had tried to teach myself about artificial intelligence multiple times and each time usually ended with me giving up due to not understanding what I was doing. What I relies now that I am never going to be able to understand everything at once and there will always be things that make no sense to me, but if I methodically work through and around them, I can still make progress.
<br><br>A great example of this was when I wasn’t able to get the GPT-2 model working and was just getting continuous errors in console. after a while of not being able to understand the errors I essentially gave up and emailed john to see if he knew what the problem was. John basically said go look at the source code of the model. Which put me back to where I was. So I now had to go and trawl through the source code which was all in python a language I knew next to nothing about to figure out the problem. To my surprise the problem was an easy fix and took all of 5 minutes to get the model up and running after this. This simple scenario really reinforced the idea that no matter what problems arise they can be fixed by methodically working through it. Something as daunting as going through source code in a language I didn’t know would have been unthinkable for me before starting this project but I have now done it on numerous occasions to get things botched together and working 
<br>The past 12 weeks has by far been the most interesting of my academic career and has taught me the most about what I am capable of if I put my mind to it. This module has been a breath of fresh air for me compared to traditional teaching and I really wish that this style of teaching could be incorporated into traditional education model
<br><br>As for the future of this project, I intend to continue working at it every now and then in the hopes to be able to get an even deeper understanding of what is essentially my favourite topic in computing.
<br><br>So I just want to thank John for selecting me for this module and allowing me to work on things that I more than likely never would have done otherwise &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p>
